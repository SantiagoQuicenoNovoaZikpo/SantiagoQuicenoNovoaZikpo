## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a dedicated Industrial Engineer and Data Scientist, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and practical experience to the table. My journey began with a robust education in Industrial Engineering from Konrad Lorenz University Foundation and San Buenaventura University, where I developed a strong foundation in engineering principles and automation technologies. With a specialized focus on Data Science, I have honed my skills in Python, R, SQL, and various data visualization tools. My experience includes designing and implementing machine learning models, performing in-depth data analysis, and developing actionable strategies to solve complex real-world problems. I have a proven track record in leveraging data to drive business insights, optimize processes, and enhance operational efficiency.

In addition to my technical background, I have several years of experience as a bilingual Mathematics, Physics, and Statistics teacher. This role helped me develop exceptional communication and instructional skills, as well as strong interpersonal abilities. I am a highly sociable individual with well-developed soft skills, including effective teamwork, conflict resolution, and negotiation. My background also includes experience in sales, where I have successfully utilized my interpersonal skills to drive results.

I have had the incredible opportunity to travel to various countries across America, Europe, and Asia. Through volunteering and engaging in diverse cultural exchanges, I have forged international connections and gained invaluable insights. These experiences have enriched my perspective, enhanced my adaptability, and strengthened my ability to collaborate with people from different backgrounds. By working on a range of projects, from community development to educational initiatives, I have honed my skills in problem-solving and cross-cultural communication. These global adventures have not only broadened my horizons but also reinforced my commitment to making a positive impact wherever I go.
